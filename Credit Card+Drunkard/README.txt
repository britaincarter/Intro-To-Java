Britain Carter, bic2106, Program 3.

Problem 1:
The Drunkard.java class is a program which simulates the movement of
a drunk person. You enter the location at which the drunkard begins then 
it returns the location of the drunk (street, avenue) using the 
DrunkardTester.java class. At the end of the program it will tell you
how far the drunk has traveled from the origin you entered. To run this
program you must compile both classes with javac Drunkard.java and the 
DrunkardTester.java class which contains the main argument. 

Problem 2:
The CreditCard.java class is a program that will validate a given 12
digit credit card number by returning whether or not it is valid. If
it is not valid it will return a number variable "codeError" which is what
step the invalidation occured in the algorithm. To run the program you
must also have the CreditCardTester.java class with the main argument. Then
compile both javac CreditCard.java as well as CreditCardTester.java then
you can run the program.
